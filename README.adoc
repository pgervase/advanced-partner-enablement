**What is Advanced Partner Enablement?	**

NOTE: We have a team focused on **delivering resources to partners** for training enablement.  The partner has **access** to these resources because they have  completed certain requirements, and are **tasked with bringing Red Hat net new customers** and building net new bookings.
